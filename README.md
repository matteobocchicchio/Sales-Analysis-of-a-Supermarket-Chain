# Data-Driven Optimization for the company in Europe – Tableau Project

## Project Description

the company is a leading European retail company that is transitioning to a data-driven decision-making model. To support its strategic goals, the company aims to implement a system for real-time monitoring of operations across Europe and to develop a targeted marketing strategy focusing on high-potential products.

As a Data Analyst, your task is to deliver an interactive Tableau solution that replaces outdated tools such as static spreadsheets and presentations.

## Project Scope

You will build a dynamic Tableau dashboard and an accompanying story to help the company make more informed decisions.

### Key Business Metrics

The dashboard will include:

- Sales Over Time: Visual representation of monthly sales trends to uncover seasonality and growth patterns.
- Profit by Country: Profit distribution across the European markets.
- Shipped Quantity by Shipping Class: Analysis of product quantities delivered by category (e.g., Standard, Express).

Users will be able to filter the dashboard by country, time period, shipping class, and product to view detailed business performance. Interactive charts will allow real-time tracking of sales, profit trends, and shipping efficiency.

### Tableau Story – Marketing Budget Allocation

the company requires an analysis to inform its marketing budget allocation. The Tableau Story will identify:

- High-priority products with strong profit margins but low sales volume.
- Low-priority products with low profitability or saturated sales.
- Products to eliminate due to cost inefficiency and poor return.

The analysis will compare product-level sales and profitability to highlight undervalued items with growth potential. The story will follow the 3C structure:
- Context: Overview of current business performance.
- Conflict: Identification of underperforming products.
- Conclusion: Recommendations for optimized marketing investment.

## Final Outcome

This Tableau-based solution will enable the company to:

- Monitor business operations effectively across European markets.
- Support strategic marketing decisions with reliable data.
- Improve resource allocation, reduce inefficiencies, and increase profitability.
